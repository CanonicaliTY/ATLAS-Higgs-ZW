# ATLAS-Higgs-ZW
This repo works as our colaborate workspace for 3 year 2nd semster lab experiment on ANALYSING EVENTS WITH Z AND HIGGS BOSONS WITH THE ATLAS EXPERIMENT.

This project aims to give some appreciation of the physics processes that can occur in high energy proton-proton collisions at the LHC and to introduce event selection and measurement methods used in particle physics data analysis.
